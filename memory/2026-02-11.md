## Cost Optimization & Model Strategy
- **Problem:** Found credit burn was $1.20 while idle (mainly from heartbeat context loading)
- **Root cause:** Had switched to Claude Opus 4.6 as primary ($5/$25 per MTok vs Haiku $1/$5 = 5x more expensive)
- **Solution:** Implemented intelligent hybrid model fallback chain:
  - **Primary:** Claude Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5) - daily driver for 95% of tasks
  - **Fallback 1:** Gemini 3 Flash (free tier when available)
  - **Fallback 2:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 ($3/$15) - for moderate complexity
  - **Fallback 3:** Claude Opus 4.6 ($5/$25) - last resort for complex reasoning
  - **Subagents:** Haiku 4.5 for background tasks
- **Savings:** ~80% cost reduction vs Opus-primary; intelligent escalation preserves quality
- **Implementation:** Config patched successfully, gateway restarted

## Skills Installed
1. **crypto-levels** - Support/resistance analysis for crypto pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
2. **binance** - Trading integration (needs API setup: BINANCE_API_KEY + BINANCE_SECRET)
3. **onchain** - Portfolio tracking, market data, CEX history, transaction lookups (needs setup: onchain setup)
4. **game-theory** - Strategic analysis for protocols, tokenomics, governance, MEV
5. **polymarket** - Prediction market odds queries (read-only, no auth needed)
6. **polymarket-agent** - Autonomous trading agent for Polymarket (needs setup: poly setup + POLYMARKET_KEY)

## Technical Notes
- Polymarket skill required `pip install requests --break-system-packages` to fix dependency
- Polymarket-agent skill ready but requires wallet configuration and API key setup
- All skills installed to `/data/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`

## User Preferences/Instructions
- Set "switch to best model by task" preference - implement hybrid config with fallbacks ✓
- Install skills proactively without asking for setup (will do setup automatically going forward)
- Preference for cost optimization while maintaining intelligence
